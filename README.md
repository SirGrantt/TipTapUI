# TipTapUI
TipTapAPI user interface. This application is being built to provide an intuitive and easy way to work with server tips, view earnings
and export that data into a format for payroll. It utilizes Drag and Drop lists with react-beautiful-dnd, Redux for state management, and React.js.

# Set Up
This project uses Cory House's react-slingshot. Everything required there is also required here. I will list important information here, but if you run into any issues checking out the repo will provide more troubleshooting options.

Download and install Node.js

Install Git.

Corey reccomends disabling safe write in your editor to assure hot reloading works.


Windows: you will have to install python and a C++ compiler.
MacOs: Cory encourages installing watchman or fswatch to avoid potential issues with ot having a file watching installed.

The intial startup of the app makes some calls to the API I built to go along with this. If you are not running that code you may run into some issues when the app starts up failing to get data.

# Run
Run npm install for the dependencies and npm start to get going!
